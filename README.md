# Dabbel Assessment

#### Technology and Libraries
Tech: Python
Libraries: datetime, random, csv, math, unittest, re and json

#### Questions:
##### Computational complexity for the match prediction algo
Assuming m is number of rows in reading list
Assuming n is number of sensors/cols

Time complexity = O(m) * O(n) =  O(m^{2}) (worst case, if m = n)
